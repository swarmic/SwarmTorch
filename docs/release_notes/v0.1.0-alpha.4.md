# SwarmTorch v0.1.0-alpha.4 Release Notes

**Date:** 2026-02-08  
**Type:** Technical White Paper + Release Notes System

## Summary

This release introduces the SwarmTorch Technical White Paper as a canonical grounding document and establishes the release notes system for contributor onboarding and audit trail.

---

## Major Changes

### SwarmTorch Technical White Paper v0.1

**What:** Created `SWARM_TORCH_TECHNICAL_WHITE_PAPER_v0.1.md` — a ~600-line normative specification document.

**Key innovations:**

1. **Claim → Evidence Convention:** Every MUST/SHOULD/MAY statement must cite an ADR or code path
2. **Implementation Status Matrix:** Maps claims to {Implemented, Partial, Planned, Non-goal}
3. **Grounded Conformance Hooks:** Appendix B lists specific commands/tests that enforce claims

**Document structure:**

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Reader's Guide | Normative language (RFC 2119), drift controls, claim→evidence convention |
| Implementation Status Matrix | Prevents aspirational scope creep |
| Abstract & Scope | What SwarmTorch is and explicitly is NOT |
| System Model | Roles, network assumptions, coordination model, transport |
| Threat Model | Three-zone trust (Trusted/Verified/Untrusted) |
| Run Graph + Artifact Spine | Bundle layout, manifest hashing, privacy requirements |
| Architecture | Crate boundaries, feature flag contract, runtime abstraction |
| Protocol | Message envelope, serialization |
| Algorithms | Aggregation, compression |
| Security Engineering | Identity, signing, gradient validation |
| DataOps | Pipeline DSL, asset model, dataset lineage |
| Developer Experience | Notebook views, dashboard, desktop wrapper roadmap |
| Operations | MSRV, docs.rs constraints, release gates |
| Integration Profiles | Swarmic Network Provider (secondary) |
| Appendices | Invariants, conformance hooks, glossary, bibliography |

**Why this matters:**
- Forces implementation claims to be grounded against code
- Provides conformance hooks for CI/CD
- Prevents whitepaper-code drift
- Serves as contributor reference

**ADR Reference:** ADR-0016, ADR-0017, ADR-0018

### Sources Bibliography

**What:** Created `SWARM_TORCH_TECHNICAL_WHITE_PAPER_v0.1.sources.md` — a ~200-line bibliography.

**Categories covered:**
- Normative keywords and versioning (RFC 2119/8174, SemVer)
- Rust ecosystem norms (API guidelines, Cargo features, MSRV, docs.rs)
- Supply chain and provenance (RustSec/cargo-audit, cargo-deny, cargo-vet, OSV, SLSA, Sigstore, GitHub attestations)
- Observability standards (W3C Trace Context, OpenTelemetry spec/semconv)
- Data lineage concepts (OpenLineage) and columnar formats (Arrow/Parquet)
- Federated learning primary research (FedAvg, Krum, Bulyan, secure aggregation, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, compression families)

**Why:** Prevents hallucinated citations; every external claim is traceable.

### Release Notes System

**What:** Created `docs/release_notes/` directory with structured release notes.

**Files:**
- `README.md` — Index with reading order
- `v0.1.0-alpha.1.md` — Initial scaffold (2025-11-12)
- `v0.1.0-alpha.2.md` — Observability + artifacts (2025-12-15)
- `v0.1.0-alpha.3.md` — Documentation + security + license (2026-02-08)
- `v0.1.0-alpha.4.md` — Whitepaper + release notes (2026-02-08)

**Purpose:**
- Audit trail for contributors
- What/why/how documentation for each implementation phase
- Higher-level understanding of codebase evolution
- Practical engineering context

**Format conventions:**
- Date + type header
- Summary section
- Major changes with tables and code examples
- ADR references
- Known limitations
- Migration notes

### Examples Directory Structure

**What:** Organized `examples/` into 6 categories with stub READMEs:

| Category | Examples | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `compliance/` | audit-logs, federated-hospital | Regulatory compliance scenarios |
| `edge/` | continual-learning, quantized-updates | Edge ML patterns |
| `embedded/` | esp32-contributor | MCU deployment |
| `privacy/` | dp-training | Differential privacy |
| `python/` | model-zoo, swarm-notebook | Python interop |
| `robotics/` | fleet-policy, poisoning-demo, topology-bench | Swarm robotics |

**Why:** Provides scaffold for future example implementations; shows scope of use cases.

**Current status:** All READMEs are stubs; implementations pending.

## Implementation Status

### Fully Implemented
- Core aggregation algorithms (FedAvg, Median, TrimmedMean, Krum)
- Compression primitives (TopK, RandomSparse, Quantized)
- Gradient validation (NaN/Inf/bounds checking)
- Message envelope with replay protection fields
- Observability IDs (TraceId, SpanId, RunId)
- Artifact bundle writer/validator with SHA-256 manifest (atomic JSON/manifest writes)
- Executable `graph.json` schema types + deterministic `node_def_hash` (SHA-256 of canonical postcard encoding)
- Dataset registry/lineage/materialization metadata schemas + fingerprint v0 helpers
- Standalone HTML report generator (bundle reader → `report.html`)
- Tokio runtime wrapper

### Partially Implemented
- Consensus primitives (data structures only; no coordinator)
- Transport abstraction (MockTransport only)
- Embassy runtime (placeholder)
- Crypto/signing (placeholder, not production)

### Planned
- Real transports (TCP, UDP, BLE, LoRa)
- `no_std` embedded builds
- GPU acceleration (WGPU-first, CUDA optional)
- Python interop (PyO3)
- Fuzzing and property-based tests

## Codebase Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Crates | 5 (core, net, runtime, models, main) |
| ADRs | 21 across 5 phases |
| Core modules | 13 (aggregation, algorithms, compression, consensus, crypto, dataops, execution, identity, lib, observe, run_graph, telemetry, traits) |
| Example categories | 6 |
| License | MPL-2.0 |
| MSRV | Rust 1.75 |

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No end-to-end swarm loop:** Crates compile and test; no working distributed training
2. **Examples are stubs:** READMEs only; code pending
3. **CI not implemented:** Supply chain gates are config-only
4. **Embedded builds fail:** `--no-default-features` not working yet

---

## Migration Notes

No API changes from v0.1.0-alpha.3.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implement transport drivers:** Start with TCP, then UDP/BLE/LoRa
2. **Fix `no_std` build:** Get embedded core building
3. **Add CI workflows:** Implement supply chain gates from SECURITY.md
4. **Flesh out examples:** Start with robotics/fleet-policy demo
5. **Create PRD:** Define Sprint 0 deliverables
