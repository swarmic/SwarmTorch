# Examples (Planned)

These directories exist to keep `readme.md` links stable while the implementation lands incrementally.

- Canonical design references: `ADRs.md` (especially ADR-0016: Run Artifacts and Visualization Surface)
- Roadmap: `ROADMAP.md`

Status: placeholders only (no runnable code yet).
