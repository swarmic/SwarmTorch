# SwarmTorch v0.1.0-alpha.3 Release Notes

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Type:** Documentation Framework + Security Guardrails + License Migration  

## Summary

This release establishes SwarmTorch's documentation hierarchy, security posture, and supply-chain controls. It also migrates the license from MIT to MPL-2.0 for file-level copyleft protection.

---

## Major Changes

### License Migration: MIT → MPL-2.0

**What:** The project license changed from MIT to Mozilla Public License 2.0.

**Why:**
- **File-level copyleft:** Modifications to MPL-covered files must be shared when distributed
- **Larger Work compatibility:** Can be combined with proprietary code without viral effect
- **Rust ecosystem adoption:** Used by Servo, many Mozilla projects
- **Middle path:** Balances openness with protection of core IP

**What this means for users:**
- You CAN use SwarmTorch in proprietary projects
- You CAN combine with MIT/Apache-2.0 code
- You MUST share changes to SwarmTorch source files if you distribute
- You do NOT need to open-source your application code

**Files changed:**
- `LICENSE` — Full MPL-2.0 text
- `Cargo.toml` — `license = "MPL-2.0"`
- `readme.md` — Badge and license section updated
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Contributor license agreement updated
- `deny.toml` — Added `MPL-2.0` to allowed licenses

**ADR Reference:** N/A (corporate decision)

---

### Documentation Hierarchy (`CONTEXT_SOURCES.md`)

**What:** Created a formal document hierarchy to prevent context drift:

| Level | Documents | Authoritative For |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Primary | `SWARM_TORCH_TECHNICAL_WHITE_PAPER_v0.1.md`, `ADRs.md`, crate source | SwarmTorch design and implementation |
| Secondary | `SWARMIC_NETWORK_WHITE_PAPER_v12.*.md` | Integration context only |

**Why:**
- Prevents AI agents from importing SwarmicOS requirements into SwarmTorch core
- Clearly defines what SwarmTorch does NOT own (RA gating, mission-plane semantics)
- Establishes canonical reference for architectural questions

**Build Agent Instructions (from CONTEXT_SOURCES.md):**
1. Start with SwarmTorch WP + ADRs for architectural questions
2. Check crate source for implementation details
3. Only consult Swarmic whitepaper for integration profiles
4. Never import mission-plane/RA/receipt requirements into core

**ADR Reference:** ADR-0008A (boundary definition)

### SwarmTorch Technical White Paper

**What:** Created `SWARM_TORCH_TECHNICAL_WHITE_PAPER_v0.1.md` as the canonical SwarmTorch reference.

**Key sections:**
- **Normative language:** RFC 2119/8174 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
- **Claim → Evidence convention:** Every normative statement must cite ADR or code
- **Implementation Status Matrix:** Maps claims to actual implementation status
- **System model:** Roles, network assumptions, coordination model
- **Threat model:** Three-zone trust boundary (Trusted/Verified/Untrusted)
- **Artifact spine:** Run bundle layout and manifest hashing
- **Conformance hooks:** Appendix B lists all gates (build, supply-chain, fuzzing)

**Why:**
- Forces grounding of claims against actual implementation
- Prevents aspirational scope creep
- Provides conformance hooks for CI/CD

**ADR Reference:** ADR-0016, ADR-0017, ADR-0018

---

### Security Posture (`SECURITY.md`)

**What:** Comprehensive security policy covering:

| Area | Policy |
|------|--------|
| Vulnerability disclosure | 90-day coordinated disclosure, private reporting |
| Supply chain | `cargo audit`, `cargo deny`, `cargo vet` |
| CI hardening | Least-privilege permissions, pinned actions |
| Release integrity | Sigstore attestations, SLSA alignment |
| `unsafe` code | Core crates forbid; adapters document

**Files created:**
- `SECURITY.md` — Full security policy
- `deny.toml` — cargo-deny configuration
- `supply-chain/README.md` — cargo-vet stub

**Why:**
- SwarmTorch targets mission-critical deployments
- Supply chain attacks are a real threat to ML systems
- Establishes clear process for security researchers

**ADR Reference:** ADR-0008, SECURITY.md

---

### ADR Consolidation

**What:** All 21 ADRs are now in a single `ADRs.md` file, organized by phase:

| Phase | ADRs |
|-------|------|
| Foundation | 0000-0003 (ADR process, backend strategy, crate topology, runtime) |
| Networking | 0004-0006A (transport, topology, staleness, serialization, identity, coordination) |
| Security | 0007-0008A (aggregation, validation, threat model, Sybil boundary) |
| Interoperability | 0009-0010 (Python, ONNX) |
| Operations | 0011-0018 (CI/CD, observability, reproducibility, benchmarks, artifacts, DataOps, extensions) |
| Acceleration | 0015 (GPU strategy) |

**Why:**
- No more broken `docs/adr/` links
- Single source of truth for architectural decisions
- Easier navigation for contributors

**Files changed:**
- `ADRs.md` — Consolidated all ADRs
- `adr-with-updates.md` — Added historical disclaimer header
- `.gitignore` — Added `docs/adr/` pattern

---

### Contributor Documentation

**What:** Created essential stub files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Development setup, PR process, code style |
| `LICENSE` | MPL-2.0 full text |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Pointer to readme.md roadmap section |
| `swarm-torch/README.md` | Crate-local pointer for docs.rs |

**Why:**
- Standard open-source project hygiene
- Clear expectations for contributors
- Proper docs.rs integration

---

### Link Hygiene

**What:** Fixed 19 broken internal links in `readme.md`:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `docs/adr/0007-robust-aggregation.md` | `ADRs.md#adr-0007-robust-aggregation-strategy` |
| `docs/SECURITY.md` | `SECURITY.md` |
| `<CONTRIBUTING.md>` | `[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)` |

**Why:**
- Broken links cause agent hallucination
- Contributors couldn't find referenced documents
- docs.rs builds need valid links

---

## Internal Documentation (Gitignored)

The following files are kept locally but excluded from the remote repository:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONTEXT_SOURCES.md` | Document hierarchy (internal drift control) |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Pointer file (internal convenience) |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security policy (internal until public disclosure process established) |

**Why:** These files contain internal process documentation that should stabilize before public exposure.

---

## Supply Chain Configuration

### `deny.toml`

**What:** cargo-deny configuration for:

- **License policy:** Allow MIT, Apache-2.0, MPL-2.0, BSD variants, ISC, CC0, Unicode-DFS-2016
- **Deny policy:** AGPL, GPL, LGPL variants (strong copyleft)
- **Copyleft handling:** Warn (not deny) for weak copyleft
- **Advisory policy:** Deny known vulnerabilities, warn on unmaintained

### `supply-chain/`

**What:** Stub directory for cargo-vet configuration.

**Next steps:**
1. Run `cargo vet init` to populate
2. Add to CI workflow

---

## Known Limitations

1. **GitHub private reporting not enabled:** Manual step in repo settings
2. **CI workflows not implemented:** Supply chain gates are config-only
3. **No PGP key:** `security-key.asc` reference removed; email/GitHub advisories only

---

## Migration Notes

### For downstream users

No API changes. License change from MIT to MPL-2.0 may affect licensing decisions.

### For contributors
